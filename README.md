What is PHP?

PHP is a server-side scripting language. This means it runs on the server, behind the scenes, to create dynamic web content.
Unlike HTML, which displays static content, PHP can generate content based on user input, information from a database, or other conditions.
This allows you to create interactive features on your website, such as login forms, shopping carts, and personalized content.

Relatively easy to learn: PHP has a clear syntax and borrows some elements from familiar languages like C.
Open-source and free: You don't need to pay to use PHP, and there are many free resources available to help you learn.
Large and supportive community: With a vast community of PHP developers, you can easily find help and answers to your questions online.
